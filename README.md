Hello World!
This is a app that gives tutorials on proper technique on how to play sports. Currently we have how to do kicking in soccer correctly. In addtion to simply providing instructions in the app, we also have a real life hardware based model of what it should look like. 

As of this current version, the aurdino controlling the servo has been connected to python but has not been connected to Google Cloud and therefore the Android studio app.
